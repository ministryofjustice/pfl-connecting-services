        Legal protection
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are court orders that can help protect you and your children from abuse:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          <strong>Non-molestation order</strong> – stops your ex-partner from threatening or being violent towards you or your children

        <li>
          <strong>Occupation order</strong> – decides who can live in the family home
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prohibited steps order</strong> – prevents specific actions, like taking children out of the country
        </li>

        Why mediation may not be right for you
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Mediation is usually not suitable when there has been domestic abuse. This is because:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>there may be an imbalance of power between you and your ex-partner</li>
        <li>you may feel pressured to agree to things that are not safe</li>
        <li>it could put you at further risk</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You are exempt from the requirement to attend a Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM) if you have experienced domestic abuse.

        Your options for making child arrangements
