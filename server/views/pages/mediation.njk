        <li><strong>Initial meeting:</strong> You may need to go to a short meeting with a mediator to assess if mediation is the right option for you. This is sometimes called a Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM).</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Mediation is usually cheaper and quicker than going to court. You may be able to get legal aid to cover the cost if you are on a low income. The usual cost of a MIAM is around £120.</li>

        <li><strong>You stay in control:</strong> Unlike in court, where a judge makes the decisions about child arrangements, in mediation you and your ex-partner decide what you agree to and what you don't.</li>
        <li><strong>Child-inclusive mediation:</strong> Children can have a voice in the process if it's suitable. A mediator can talk to your child about what they want to make sure their views are heard.</li>
        <li><strong>Court is still an option:</strong> If the mediator does not think mediation is right for you, they might advise you to go to court instead.</li>
